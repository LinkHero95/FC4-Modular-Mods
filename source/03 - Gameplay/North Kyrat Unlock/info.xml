	<Description>North Kyrat Unlock

	Unlocks North Kyrat from the beginning of the game.

	Changes made by this mod:
	[list]
	[*] Opens the Northern half of Kyrat from the beginning of the game. It will still be covered in fog until you climb bell towers to remove the "fog of war" and reveal the map.
	[*] The King's Bridge will still warn you "Dangerous Territory Ahead" when you try to go into the north, but the game will not prevent you from doing so should you wish to. 
	[/list]
