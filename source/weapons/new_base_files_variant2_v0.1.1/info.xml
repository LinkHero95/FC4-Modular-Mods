        Creator's Notes:
        [list]
		[*] This mod is compatible (and meant to be used) with one of the variants of the shop file. It is not necessary though.
        [*] This mod works best when you start a new game. It has not been tested with existing save games. I do not know what will happen if this is used with an existing save game.
        [*] This mod will clash with any mod which edits weapon files, notably any of the open world mods, or the competent weapons mod.
        [*] This mod will also clash with any other mod which adds new files to the game via the entitylibrary.fcb file, until I figure out how to add code to the xml via the info.xml.
        [*] This mod is [b]experimental[/b]. Some bugs may occur. If you do find anything amiss, contact me at my email linkhero95@gmail.com.
