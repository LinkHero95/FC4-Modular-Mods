        Changes made by this mod:
        [list]
        [*] All weapons are unlocked when player arrives in Banapur.
        [*] Unlocks the signature assault rifle ACE (signature variant of the A52) which was removed in the vanilla game.
        [*] Unlocks all available attachments for all weapons. Weapon slots are modded in a separate package.
        [*] Reorders all weapons so that similar weapons are together i.e. all SMGs, all Shotguns, etc are grouped together.
        [*] Weapons [b]do not[/b] unlock by liberating radio towers.
        [*] The sticky explosives and the Guns for hire token upgrades still require the 'Black Market' skill to unlock.
