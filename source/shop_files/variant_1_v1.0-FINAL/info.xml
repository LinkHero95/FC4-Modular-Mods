    <Description>Shop File (Variant 1)
        Modifies files for the in-game shop.

        Changes made by this mod:
        [list]
        [*] All weapons are unlocked when player arrives in Banapur.
        [*] Unlocks the signature assault rifle ACE (signature variant of the A52) which was removed in the vanilla game.
        [*] Unlocks all available attachments for all weapons. Weapon slots are modded in a separate package.
        [*] The sticky explosives and the Guns for hire token upgrades still require the 'Black Market' skill to unlock.
        [/list]

        Modded by JRavens. I have only packed it in the package format.
